Hello world!

This is Somebody, really this is Somebody! I’m thrilled about some things, and I’m here to share what I'll find interesting for myself.
## Little about me
My name is Moein Hosseini. I write code in Scala, Java and Python and have been working as Software and Data Engineer for almost 6 years.

I was born in Iran, finished my education and met my lovely wife there. We've been living in London since 2020, and I work as Senior Software Engineer at [Quantcast](https://qunatcast.com).

These days I'm learning how to plan piano, the only instrument that I've ever touched.

You can find more about my work experiences in [**moein.xyz**](https://moein.xyz).

## What will you hear from me?
To be honest there are few things that cheer me up, mostly solving a problem using programming or figuring out something related to it. 

Here I would probably share some stuff related to programming, JVM and Big Data.
